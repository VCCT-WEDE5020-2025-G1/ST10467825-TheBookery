## Features

## Changelog
 - Version 0.1
 Started laying the foundation for the website. After identifying how many site pages would be necessary, all the necessary HTML files were made for the pages.
 I added a stylesheet and set up a basic style for the main title.
 Keeping this start very simple.
 
 - Version 0.2
 Added all the additional folders for some file structure and uniformity.
 Got started with some test assets to put in my asset folder and set up some image displays.

 - Version 0.3 (Current)
Started styling the site to look like the wireframes. Implemented a standard navbar across all pages as well as a footer section, some navlinks and some animations/effects on the home buttons I pointed out on the wireframes. Grouped things a bit better to allow for better manuverability and customisations. Probably going to start adding all the colours I mentioned in my proposal and see if they work well together or if I am going to work on a different colour palette.
